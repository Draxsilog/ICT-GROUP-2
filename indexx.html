   <h1> Thank you for the memories! </h1>
   <p> The computer lab was more than just a room filled with screens and keyboards; it was a realm of unforgettable experiences. From coding sessions, where
the hum of the computers harmonized with the tapping of keys, to the exhilirating rush of finishing a challenging project just before the deadline. It was where friendships
were forged over shared frustrations and triumphs, where we laughed over inside jokes while debugging lines of code. Every moment spent in that lab felt like a journey
of discovery, pushing boundaries, and unlocking new potentials. It's where we're not only learned about technology but also perseverance, collaboration, and the sheer
joy of creating something from lines of code. The memories created in that lab will forever be etched in our minds, a testament to the transformative power of education
and camarederie. </p>
